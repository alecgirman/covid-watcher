# COVID-19 Watcher
### Author: Alec Girman

A simple script to automatically fetch all sorts of COVID-19 related data.

Currently only fetches US data per-county and global data as a whole.

## Instructions:

`git clone https://github.com/alecgirman/covid-watcher`

`python3 covid.py`

This will start the script to run indefinitely.  If you just want to collect the current data without running indefinitely, you can launch it with the --once option.

`python3 covid.py --once`
